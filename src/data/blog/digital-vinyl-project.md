I made a new project! I am particularly proud of this one for the immense amount of skills and knowledge I have learned. Looking back just a few years ago I would not have been able to do this because I lacked the pre-requisite skills. This project acts almost like a "picture book" of sorts as it includes some elements or aspects of a skill I picked up through co-op, school, or self-learning. As always I want to provide recognition, support, and thanks to those that built the groundwork for this project. I also hope that I can help and contribute back to the open-source community as well. I have made my project available public and will add some links below so you can try out aspects of this project as well. Expect to see open-source contributions from me on tools that I utilized in this project (ex. Nowify) in the coming few weeks!

The Modified Nowify Version of the project which I used for this project can be found at:

 Note: you will be unable to try this out at this moment since the Spotify Authentication API I have access to is still in developer mode. I will update here once I apply for public access and have been accepted for public use (right now only testers I have granted access to can utilize this).

If I find I missed some links or feel I need to give credit to someone else as well I will be sure to do so by updating the list above.

\[1]: The projects steps are not the same and this project does not use the Spotify-RFID-Record-Player Git repository mentioned in the video or Python or Harcoded Spotify UUIDs in the program for that matter but it is still a good tutorial for anyone else looking to make a similar project and I encourage others to see
