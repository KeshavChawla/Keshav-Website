### Hey!

</br>

I just came here to showcase one of the things I have been working on the side.
</br>

I have become increasingly annoyed by the clutter some of the new tab extensions on the google chrome store create.
</br>

No, I don’t need to have chrome set Google as my home page, and I don’t need to see a list of recently visited sites either. All my important sites are already placed in my Bookmark bar, and I can access Google directly from the embedded search bar.
</br>

Come to think of it, I don’t even really need a homepage or fancy new tab extension.
</br>

I just want something simple. By simple, I just wanted a nice blank screen that only showed me the following:

<ul style="list-style: inside; padding: auto;">
<li>The date</li>
<li>The time</li>
<li>A nice motivational quote</li>
</ul>
</br>

That’s it—nothing less and nothing more. So really, I built [Simplex - a chrome extension](https://bit.ly/SIMPLEX) just for me. But here’s to hoping that someone else will also find similar use for Simplex.
</br>

I don’t see this as something I plan to support long term, but if you find some use, let me know, and I might just reconsider.
</br>

It didn’t take too long or require too much effort either; just some simple Javascript and an Ajax call to [this API](https://favqs.com/api).
</br>

<em>Update: Since 2022 I have removed this extension from the chrome store since some of the quotes from the API were not optimal. At some point I will put this back up when I find a better API source to view quotes from which have been vetted. But until then, this project served its purpose. The favqs API is still a good API to mess around with without needing to deal with tokens.</em>
